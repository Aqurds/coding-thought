# The code creates a form using form_with to submit new comments associated with a post and sets the form's URL to the user_post_comments_path.
# Within the form, it includes a text area labeled "Comments Box" for users to enter their comment text.
# A submit button labeled "Submit Comment" is provided for users to submit the form.
# The form is wrapped in HTML <div> elements for organization, and the entire structure is written in ERB syntax for a Ruby on Rails view.
