# The code generates an HTML form using form_for for creating a new post associated with the :post model.
# The form is configured to be submitted to the user_posts_path with the @user parameter.
# It includes text input fields for the post title and a text area for post details.
# A submit button is provided to submit the form, and the entire structure is written in ERB syntax for a Ruby on Rails view.
